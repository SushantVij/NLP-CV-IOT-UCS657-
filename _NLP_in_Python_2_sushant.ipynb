I\\'d appreciateyour discretion.Of course.You have my word.Thank you.Have a safe flight home.Policing cities isa thorny enough issue as it is,but allowing superheroesinto national defense?We\\'d basically beprivatizing war.Good night, Hughie.You\\'ll lock up?- Yeah.- Yeah.Thanks, Gary.Sorry, we\\'re closing up.Hello?Who are you?The fuck?Right in front of you, prick.You think I wouldn\\'t findthis thing?Hughie.You pussy, I followed youfrom the fucking Tower.No, no, no!Who\\'s that guy you were with,in the car?- Who was he?!- I don\\'t...- He put you up to this?- I don\\'t know!He was just some Uber driver,okay?Don\\'t give me some bullshit!Uber driver!Do you thinkI\\'m a fucking idiot?- Why\\'d you plant the bug?- Please.Please, please, please.No, please.We\\'re The Seven,Earth\\'s most mighty,champions of the innocent,motherfucker!Sorry about the mess.You should fuck off, Hughie.Hughie, run!Well, well, well,if it ain\\'t the invisible cunt.There you are.So who are you?Fucking spy?For who?
