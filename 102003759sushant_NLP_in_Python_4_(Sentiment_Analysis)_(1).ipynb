        "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
        "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
        "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",

        "Positive: Comedians who tend to have a generally positive, upbeat tone in their comedy routines, with little to no negativity or sarcasm. This might include comedians who focus on \"clean\" or family-friendly humor, or who specialize in feel-good comedy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neutral: Comedians who have a relatively neutral tone in their comedy routines, with a mix of positive and negative elements. This might include comedians who use a lot of observational humor, or who tell stories that have both funny and serious elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Negative: Comedians who tend to have a more negative or cynical tone in their comedy routines, with a lot of sarcasm or biting humor. This might include comedians who specialize in political or social commentary, or who use a lot of profanity or edgy material.\n",
        "\n",
        "Subjective: Comedians who have a very personal or subjective style of comedy, with a lot of personal anecdotes or opinions. This might include comedians who use a lot of self-deprecating humor, or who share personal stories about their own lives.\n",
        "  \n",
        "As now we have decided the categories for classification, we should consider the threshold value of polarity and subjectivity for such type of classification:\n",
        "As polairy varies between -1 and 1, therefore we will keep 0 as neutral tone and -1 for highly negative and +1 for highly positive.\n",
        "As subjectivty varies bewteen 0 and 1, therefor we will keep 0.5  for normal behaviour which consist of both opinios and facts as well and 0 for highly fact things and 1 for highly subjective things.\n",
